# Herodotus Data Processor (HDP)

[![CI](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> **Warning:** This codebase is experimental and not audited. Use at your own risk.

HDP enhances off-chain compute capabilities with zkVMs for verifiable on-chain data integration. For more, visit our [documentation](https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/developers/herodotus-data-processor-hdp).

## Introduction

The HDP CLI is designed to process human-readable requests and convert them into a format acceptable to Cairo programs. This conversion is a crucial part of the preprocessing step, which prepares data for subsequent off-chain computations in zkVM environments. The CLI not only facilitates this transformation but also offers additional features to support development and testing.

## Features

- **Development Tools**: Encode and decode data lakes and computational tasks.
- **Core Processing**: Compile data from various sources and compute aggregate functions.
- **Extensibility**: Support for multiple blockchain integrations and various ZKVM backends is planned.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides a CLI for easy interaction with the system.

## Install HDP

### Install with cargo

```bash
# Install with cargo
❯ cargo install --git https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp --locked --force
```

### Build from source

```bash
# clone repo
❯ git clone https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp.git

## Integration Testing

Integration testing in HDP ensures that the functionality of aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `COUNT` operates correctly across various numeric fields within the blockchain data structure. These functions are designed specifically for numeric data types, ensuring accurate and reliable computations.

### Testing Environment

Our integration tests utilize `script/integration.sh` to verify the correct operation of each function across the supported fields. To execute these tests locally, refer to the [Integration Test Guide](./example/readme.md) for detailed instructions.

### Supported Aggregate Functions

- **SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT**: These functions are supported only for fields with numeric values.

### Function Support Matrix

Here is the support matrix indicating which blockchain elements are tested for each aggregate function. The matrix highlights fields where these functions are applicable.

_Note: Fields marked with "-" are not applicable for the specified aggregate functions because they do not contain numeric data or the data type is not suitable for these calculations._

### Additional Notes

- Please ensure that the data fields you are applying these functions contain numeric values to avoid computational errors.
- For details on how these tests are performed or to contribute to the further development of tests, please refer to the [Integration Test Guide](./example/readme.md).

```

## Defining Your Own Module

For developers interested in extending the functionality of HDP by adding new modules, follow the steps outlined below. This guide assumes a basic understanding of Rust and its module system.

### Getting Started

1. **Module Location**: Start by creating a new module within the `aggregate_fn` directory. You can find this at [aggregation_fn/mod.rs](./crates/core/src/aggregate_fn).

2. **Define Enum**: Define your new function as an enum in the [file](./crates/core/src/aggregate_fn). Make sure to add match arms for the new enum variants in the implementation.

3. **Handle Data Types**: Depending on the expected input type for your function:
   - **Integer Inputs**: Use [`U256`](https://docs.rs/alloy-primitives/latest/alloy_primitives/index.html#reexport.U256) for handling large integers compatible with Ethereum's numeric constraints.
   - **String Inputs**: Use Rust's standard `String` type for text data.

### Integration with Existing Functions

For a practical example of how to integrate context-sensitive operations, refer to the implementation of the [`COUNT`](./core/src/aggregate_fn/integer.rs#L118) function. This example shows how to pass and utilize additional context for operations, which can be particularly useful for conditional processing or complex calculations.

### Testing Your Module

After implementing your new function, it's crucial to verify its functionality:

- **Create Unit Tests**: Add tests in the corresponding test file in the `tests` directory. Ensure your tests cover all new logic to maintain stability and reliability.
- **Test for Integer Types**: Pay special attention to functions that handle integer types, ensuring they correctly process and output values fitting within a `bytes32` length, reflecting Ethereum's data type constraints.
